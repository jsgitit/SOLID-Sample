Key takeaways:

1. Prefer small, cohesive interfaces to large, expansive ones.
2. Following ISP helps with SRP and LSP
3. Break up large interfaces, by using
	- interface inheritence
	- use Adapter design pattern 
		(to allow new code to depend on a small cohesive interface, without breaking existing code that may use the larger interace.)
